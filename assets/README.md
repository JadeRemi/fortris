# Public Assets

This directory contains static assets that are served directly by the web server.

## Usage
- Files here are accessible via absolute paths (e.g., `/assets/images/logo.png`)
- Assets are not processed by Vite's build system
- Use for assets referenced in HTML or accessed via direct URLs

## Directories
- `images/` - Image files (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.)
- `audio/` - Audio files (MP3, WAV, OGG, etc.)
